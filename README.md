# release-candidate static site generator

*PURPOSE* This branch is to set up a dev environment for developing static site 
content

1. Make sure that your filesystem is mounted by running `|mount /===`
2. Copy your working files into your pier at `/web/static-site`
3. Can now visit `localhost:8080/~~/static-site/<your-path>` to see your rendered page
4. When you are ready to render your site to html, you run `|static` in the dojo
5. Complete site output at `<pier>/.urb/put/web/static-site`
